This is a repository that allows me to track my progress as I learn about php. I
am using w3Schools as my guide to learning php. By the end of the tutorial I
want to be able to: i) Understand the basic structure of php code ii) Write a
simple php function, well commented iii)Build a simple php project

Let's learn!
